Bangor-South Haven Heritage Water Trail,Published,What controls will limit users from any mischief?,Published,"<p>Paddlers in general are an environmentally friendly group of people.

Bangor-South Haven Heritage Water Trail,Published,"What about jet skiers, jet boats, etc.?",Published,<p>Lack of open water and the risk of damage due to submerged logs should limit use of motorized craft.

The best thing you can do it clearly assert your right to silence, request an attorney, and kindly refuse to answer any questions. Remember, you have a right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you.&nbsp;</span></p>",12/16/2024 16:23:41,,

Your attorney is ethically prohibited from revealing these communications to any third-party who is not a member of the Public Defender&apos;s Office. If you have family or anyone else present during an attorney-client meeting, the communication is no longer protected by privilege. This means they could potentially be called to testify about what you and your attorney discussed. The best thing to do is have meetings with only your attorney and members of the Public Defender&apos;s Office and do not share information that you and your attorney discussed with anyone else.&nbsp;</span></p>",12/16/2024 16:25:44,,
